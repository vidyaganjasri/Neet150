# ✅ Deep Dive: First Approach (3 Separate Validations)

In this approach, we validate the board in three separate steps:

1. **Each row**  
2. **Each column**  
3. **Each of the 9 sub-squares (3x3 grids)**

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Row Validation

We loop through each row (from index 0 to 8).  
For every row:

- We create a new `set()` to track digits.  
- For each cell in that row, we skip `.` (empty cell).  
- If the digit already exists in the set, it’s a duplicate → return `False`.  
- Otherwise, add the digit to the set.

✅ This ensures each row contains only unique digits.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Column Validation

We loop through each column (from index 0 to 8).  
For every column:

- Create a `set()` to track digits.  
- For each row index, we check the value in that column.  
- Again, skip `.` and check for duplicates the same way.

✅ This ensures each column contains only unique digits.

## 🔹 Step 3: 3x3 Sub-grid Validation

Now this is the part you explained deeply — let’s walk through it exactly as intended.

### 🧠 How do we identify the 9 sub-grids?

We label the 3×3 subgrids from **0 to 8** like this:
+-----+-----+-----+
| 0 | 1 | 2 |
+-----+-----+-----+
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
+-----+-----+-----+
| 6 | 7 | 8 |
+-----+-----+-----+
So we loop: `for square in range(9)`

---

### 🧩 Step 3.1: Get top-left coordinates of that square

To find out **where that particular square starts** on the board, we compute:

- `square_row = (square // 3) * 3`  
  → This gives us the **starting row index** of the 3x3 grid.

- `square_col = (square % 3) * 3`  
  → This gives us the **starting column index** of the 3x3 grid.

📌 **Why multiply by 3?**  
Each box is **3 rows high and 3 columns wide**, so multiplying gives us the exact position of the top-left corner of the grid.

**Example:**  
If `square = 4`  
- `square_row = (4 // 3) * 3 = 3`  
- `square_col = (4 % 3) * 3 = 3`  
→ So the grid starts at **(3, 3)**

---

### 🔁 Step 3.2: Loop through 3x3 inner cells

To check all 9 cells in the subgrid, we use two inner loops:

```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        square_inner_row = square_row + i
        square_inner_col = square_col + j
```
We increment by i and j from the top-left corner to cover the full 3×3 area.

For each cell, skip . and check for duplicates in a square_set.

📌 If a duplicate is found → return False.

## 🧾 Skip Empty Cells
Across all three checks, whenever we encounter a '.' (empty cell), we simply continue.
This is because empty cells don’t violate any rules — we’re only validating existing numbers.

### ✅ Conclusion
If the board passes all three checks — row, column, and sub-grid — without returning False, then it's valid and we return True.

### 🗣️ How to Say It in an Interview (Polished)
I'm validating a Sudoku board by ensuring that all rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids contain only unique digits.

For the rows and columns, I use simple loops and a set to track duplicates, skipping empty cells.

The interesting part is the 3x3 subgrids — I number them from 0 to 8 and use integer division and modulo to find which subgrid I’m currently validating.
I compute the top-left cell of the current 3x3 square by multiplying those coordinates by 3. Then, using two nested loops, I traverse all 9 cells inside that square.

If any duplicate is found during row, column, or square validation, I return False. If the board passes all checks, I return True.
